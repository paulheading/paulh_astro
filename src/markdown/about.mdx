# About

Hey üëã I'm Paul, a Front-end Designer & Developer.

I've been a Developer since 2020 and a Designer for over 10 years. I work in the **Digital Products** team at the [Barbican](https://barbican.org.uk) and spend my time creating better website experiences.

Before 2020, I worked as a¬†[Designer](https://www.creativelivesinprogress.com/article/paul-heading)¬†üë®‚Äçüé® in the [Barbican Design Studio](https://www.creativelivesinprogress.com/article/barbican).

### What have I made

- I built this site! It's made in ~~[Next.js](https://nextjs.org)~~ [Astro](https://astro.build) and pulls data from [Trello](https://trello.com) (which I use as a super simple CMS). I also pull data from [Spotify](https://spotify.com) and [NPM](https://npmjs.com) to create my desktop layout (below).

- I recently finished creating [Spark the Cannon](/project/sparking-the-cannon-with-nextjs/) in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

- I build and design lots of website functionality for the Barbican. I've recently been building the front-end for an [Events Management App](/project/organising-spaces-with-graphql) in [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/).

I also upload videos alongside projects here for extra context. If you'd like to see more information on a particular project, please do let me know.

Take a look at my [resume page](/resume) for more examples.

### How did I get here

For me, design and development are about communicating ideas, removing obstacles and bringing joy where possible.

I began by working in print design (at [Skye Creative](http://www.skyecreative.co.uk/) and [Brandwave](https://brandwavemarketing.com/)) before joining the [Barbican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbican_Centre) as a Junior Designer in 2013. From there I moved further into digital design, creating trailers for the in-house cinemas and animating HTML5 advertising.

During those years, I also began mentoring a young designer ([Ernest Wereko](https://www.ernestwereko.com/)) and built the website/brand for [36 Bourne Street](/project/selling-designer-fabric-with-wordpress/). This was the start of my journey into professional web development, and I began studying the [Full Stack Javascript Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/plans) at [TeamTreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com).
