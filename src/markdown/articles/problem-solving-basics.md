# Problem solving basics

Design is primarily about **communicating ideas and solving problems**. The ideas you communicate should in turn contribute to your desired outcome.

Over time it becomes easier (through some generic concepts) to identify bad assumptions in this process. I've listed some of the concepts (below) which will make you more productive with your time.

### What is a good outcome?

Outcomes justify the existence of your product. They can be anything from "raising awareness of your product", "creating excitement around your product" or "making your product easier to use". **You define your outcomes** and acheiving them is **your measure of success**.

### Can outcomes ever be bad then?

Of course, that's why its important to understand the details:

1. Vague outcomes are common and can waste your time; acheiving something unspecific or unuseful.

2. Unintended outcomes can create more problems than they solve.

### So what concepts are useful?

Here's a list of concepts that I find useful in my design process:

1. By combining simple ideas, we can create complex outcomes: When writing code create functions with very specific outcomes. This is easier to read, understand and debug. Its also easier to see which assertions are incorrect and where there are gaps in your understanding.

2. To find correct solutions, you need to ask the correct questions: It seems obvious to focus on solutions, but understanding the specifics of your problem is also important. After all it's not much use solving the wrong problem, or worse, creating an entirely new one.

3. The three types of knowledge:

a) The stuff "you know you know"

b) the stuff "you know you dont know"

c) the stuff "you dont know you dont know"

In my experience its virtually impossible to work solely in (a). Instead, by growing (b) and reducing (c) you will improve your awareness, becoming a better problem solver, and a more empathetic person.

### Got anything more specific?

Sure, here's a couple more concepts I picked up writing javascript:

be verbose, be a good storyteller, good code should read like a fun 90s movie. predictable, enjoyable. definitely not a mystery, no plot twists.

DRY, repetition introduces variation and reducs consistency => the beauty of less code
