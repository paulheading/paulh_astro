# Problem solving basics

### What does "design mindset" mean?

Well, design is primarily about **communicating ideas and problem solving**. There are some concepts we can use to help us do this. By implementing these concepts in your critical thinking, you will develop a design mindset.

### And what are good ideas?

A good idea is one which contributes to your desired outcome.

### So what is a good outcome?

Outcomes justify the existence of your product. They can be anything from "raising awareness of your product", "creating excitement around your product" or "making your product easier to use". **You define your outcomes** and acheiving them is your measure of success.

### Can outcomes ever be bad then?

Of course, that's why its always important to understand the detail:

1. Vague outcomes are common and can waste your time; acheiving something unspecific or unuseful.

2. Unintended outcomes can create more problems than they solve.

### So what concepts are useful?

Here's a list of concepts that I find useful in my own design process:

1. Combine simple ideas to create complex outcomes: When writing code you should create functions with very specific outcomes. This will be easier to read and understand. It will be easier to debug and understand. It will be easier to see where your assertions are incorrect, and where the gaps in your understanding exist.

2. To find correct solutions, you need to ask the correct questions:

3. The three types of knowledge:

be verbose

DRY

the beauty of less code
