# Problem solving basics

I think most problems can be solved with design mindset... design is primarily about **communicating ideas and problem solving**. There are some useful concepts that help us do this... a good idea is any idea which contributes to your desired outcome.

### So what is a good outcome?

Outcomes justify the existence of your product. They can be anything from "raising awareness of your product", "creating excitement around your product" or "making your product easier to use". **You define your outcomes** and acheiving them is your measure of success.

### Can outcomes ever be bad then?

Of course, that's why its important to understand the details:

1. Vague outcomes are common and can waste your time; acheiving something unspecific or unuseful.

2. Unintended outcomes can create more problems than they solve.

### So what concepts are useful?

Here's a list of concepts that I find useful in my own design process:

1. By combining simple ideas, we can create complex outcomes: When writing code you should create functions with very specific outcomes. This will be easier to read, understand and debug. It will be easier to see which assertions are incorrect and where there are gaps in your understanding.

2. To find correct solutions, you need to ask the correct questions: It seems obvious to focus on solutions, but understanding the specifics of your problem is also important. After all, it's not much use solving a problem that you never really had, or worse, creating an entirely new one. Also see "GIGO" computing concept

3. The three types of knowledge: The stuff "you know you know" (a), the stuff "you know you dont know" (b) and the stuff "you dont know you dont know" (c). In my experience, its virtually impossible to work solely in (a). By growing (b) and reducing (c) you will grow your awareness and empathy and become a better problem solver.

### Got anything more specific?

Sure, here's a couple more concepts I picked up writing javascript:

be verbose, be a good storyteller, good code should read like a fun 90s movie. predictable, enjoyable. definitely not a mystery, no plot twists.

DRY, repetition introduces variation and reducs consistency => the beauty of less code
