The ideas you communicate should in turn contribute to your desired outcome.\n\nOver time it becomes easier to identify bad assumptions in the process. I've listed some concepts below which will help make you a more productive problem solver.\n\n<br>\n\n### What is a good outcome?\n\nOutcomes justify the existence of your product. They can be anything from \"raising awareness of your product\", \"creating excitement around your product\" or \"making your product easier to use\". **You define your outcomes** and acheiving them is **your measure of success**.\n\n<br>\n\n### Can outcomes ever be bad then?\n\nYes, that's why its important to understand the details:\n\n1. Vague outcomes are common and can waste your time; acheiving something unspecific or unuseful.\n\n2. Unintended outcomes can create more problems than they solve.\n\n<br>\n\n### So what concepts are useful?\n\nHere's some concepts that I find useful in my design process:\n\n#### Combine simple ideas to create complex outcomes:\n\nIn javascript this means; write functions with specific inputs/outputs. This is easier to read, understand and debug. It creates less room for incorrect assumptions and gaps in your understanding.\n\nBeyond javascript this means; break down your problems and spend time prioritising what outcomes are important. This will give you a stronger sense of self and give you a more flexible mindset.\n\n<br>\n\n#### To find correct solutions, ask the correct questions:\n\nWhen solving problems it feels intuitive to focus on solutions, but it's also important to understand the specifics of your problem. After all it's not much use solving the wrong problem, or worse, creating an entirely new one.\n\n<br>\n\n#### There are three types of knowledge:\n\na) The stuff \"you know, you know\"\n\nb) the stuff \"you know, you dont know\"\n\nc) the stuff \"you dont know, you dont know\"\n\nIn my experience its almost impossible to work solely in (a). Instead, by growing (b) and reducing (c) you will improve your awareness, becoming a better problem solver, and a more empathetic person.\n```",

        "desc": "```\nIn February 2020, we redesigned the account dashboard for users of the Barbican [ticketing site](https://tickets.barbican.org.uk/).\n\n---\n\n> I’m a web designer and developer whose learning to write more interesting stories and less complex code. I work for the [Barbican](http://barbican.org.uk/), an arts centre in London.\n\n<br>\n\n### **The Project**\n\nIn February 2020, we redesigned the account dashboard for users of the Barbican [ticketing site](https://tickets.barbican.org.uk/).\n\n**Why?** The existing design was functional, but not great for browsing on mobile and didn’t reflect the brand very strongly.\n\n**How?** Combine Vue.js with the Spektrix ticketing API and do a re-design in Figma.\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n### Our Response\n\nWe knew this online space would evolve. We expected the number of services provided (and the way we provide them) to change fairly often, so it was important the design could handle iteration gracefully.\n\nOur **Digital Products** team is small at the [Barbican](https://barbican.org.uk/) so we have to be agile when we build. The hardest part of this project would be in transitioning our ticketing experience from an iframe-based interaction to a feature-rich API-driven one.\n\nDoing this meant we could improve fundamentals such as:\n\n- How functionality appears (and responds on smaller screens)\n- The accessibility of page content\n- How meaningful interactions are\n   (ie. receiving confirmation that information has been saved on update)\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*iSO0-WYH22NWgefKnSnWWw.jpeg\">\n\n_A view of the Barbican Centre from the lakeside. It is Europe’s largest art centre and home to a concert hall, 2 art galleries, 2 theatres, 3 cinemas, a rooftop conservatory and a residential estate._\n\n<br>\n\n### **How we planned it**\n\nRemoving assumptions is an important part of the design process, so we used various exercises to include a wide range of contributions.\n\nWe began with a card sorting exercise, asking several people to sort functionality into groups based on their assumptions. This helped create more intuitive account navigation.\n\nNext, we ran crazy eights. For this exercise, each group member was asked to sketch eight ideas in eight minutes. This is usually done by folding a sheet of paper into eight pieces and scribbling an idea into each one.\n\nThis process is designed to quickly generate simple ideas, which can then be iterated upon during the prototype stage.\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*AnfnUpDO-iSNrsv-BHyY6Q.png\">\n\n_Ideas for Crazy Eights are typically sketched on a single sheet of A4 paper._\n\n<br>\n\n### **How we designed it**\n\nPrototypes are designed & shared online using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).\n\nAt this point, we can create working layouts, which are informed by our group research, and can also be shared with our user panel for further testing.\n\nThese prototypes don’t always look immediately similar to the final product. Sometimes more complex designs are refined during multiple rounds of testing.\n\nIn this case, the final design was inspired by the [Tate Shop](https://shop.tate.org.uk/).\n\nI love how you can navigate this layout without extra menus. The browsing experience is very similar on all screen sizes. You don’t need to re-learn how to browse on smaller screens (or vice versa) as there is very little content shift. I found this to be very elegant.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687271828380/a845476b-287d-4e41-91c8-6cc17e5c8aaa.png\">\n\n_The account area for the Tate Shop inspired much of our design work. The modular layout became a flexible foundation for our build._\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687271798440/39ccb8f3-27be-4003-9f89-f5e9fde3b352.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n### **How we built it**\n\nEverything built on our [ticketing](https://tickets.barbican.org.uk/) site is based on the popular front-end toolkit [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). This enables us to build consistently and predictably, speeding up development and improving user experience.\n\nWe also use the [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) resource. It’s a large, beautiful library of icons, that adds to this consistency.\n\n> This article is still being written.

Most users just need an easy way to view which spaces are available, and which are not.\n\n**How?** Create an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API#Web_APIs) which makes data available from the current events system. We’ll then feed that data into a new [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) app via [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).\n\n> This project has already taken 2 years to reach the first round of testing. I’m going to write a series of posts about it. This is part one.\n\nThe current events system (let's call it Filofax) does a decent job of organising events, but is now old and faces some problems:\n\n- **It’s generic.** It’s not designed for the very unique spaces and systems at the Barbican.\n- **It’s technical.** Some staff use **Filofax** daily and have a good understanding of its features. Most do not.\n- **It’s old.** Solutions have been created by users over time in ways that were never intended. The system is no longer intuitive.\n- **It’s ugly.** The interface lacks direction and clarity. There’s no curation of information and no sense of priority.\n- **It’s inaccessible.** You need server access and specific training just to get started. That’s a major barrier to entry.\n\n<br>\n\n### Our Response\n\nWe’re a small team, so we use [Agile](https://www.apm.org.uk/resources/find-a-resource/agile-project-management/) project management. The idea is to achieve maximum impact as quickly as possible. We break up work into very specific “tickets” and prioritise those tickets according to the goals of the project. Every 2 weeks, we assess how the project is going, and then create more tickets.\n\nOur priority [user story](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories) was “_I want to easily view event data in an intuitive and useful way_”. Therefore, we didn’t focus on themes such as event management/creation quite yet. Also, **Filofax** already provides this functionality for more advanced users.\n\nWe articulated several user stories from our initial brief, and so I began responding to these by creating wireframes in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687194758654/a6a5c0be-dc5f-40c4-a272-5981eb1cdc16.jpeg\">\n\nI decided there were 3 simple steps necessary to build a view of the event data. The first one was date selection. At this stage, the user can only choose a single-day view. Ranges are not available.\n\n> Users needed to have quick entry into the app, so we implemented Office365 authentication. This is the same way we authenticate users' email or website access, so often the login happened without their knowledge.\n\nThere is also a sidebar included in the wireframes. It’s not currently included in the build but is the plan for developing app functionality. It contains potential features such as:\n\n- **Alerts:** Users could “watch” events and receive notifications when those events change\n- **Search:** A dedicated search area\n- **Snapshots:** A collection of saved event data “views”. Useful for repetitive searches, such as: “all confirmed events in the Theatre and Concert Hall every Thursday”\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687194715184/ac870b72-cfdd-4e37-8c06-5b1d8b15bf2a.jpeg\">\n\nThis step was inspired by functionality included in the excellent [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/creating-a-field-group/) [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) plugin. I love how the elegant interface allows users to build pretty complex queries.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687194645337/c4921fd3-752b-4e09-b3af-0b150d15c93c.jpeg\">\n\nWe had 3 ideas for useful ways to show our event data:\n\n- **Map View:** Groups spaces into levels. This helps users understand which spaces are close together, and where noisy performances may affect your booking. This view is not yet available.\n- **Gantt View:** The “Garageband” view collects event bookings into groups and displays them as a single bar on a chart. This helps users understand which bookings clash and overlap.\n- **List View:** The most basic view. It displays a paginated list of results, but data has been grouped into collections of related events. You’re also able to sort the data by various categories.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687194902839/ffd0bdba-f40d-4a68-b0c2-5a9e4bcfdd63.jpeg\">\n\nIn **Map View**, live performances pulsate to denote the noise around them\n\nBoth Map and Gantt views contain several similarities:\n\n- An extra sidebar (in this case, denoting each level)\n- A horizontally scrolling timeline (with a marker to denote the time of day)\n\nEach view also contains navigation for:\n\n- switching between day views\n- switching between view modes\n- editing filter settings\n- viewing the additional event information\n\n> This article is still being written.

The system is no longer intuitive.</li>\n<li><strong>It’s ugly.</strong> The interface lacks direction and clarity. There’s no curation of information and no sense of priority.</li>\n<li><strong>It’s inaccessible.</strong> You need server access and specific training just to get started.
